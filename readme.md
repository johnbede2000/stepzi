# Stepzi

Planning app built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

I initially had validation which forced users to fill in the input fields, but removed this because anyone checking out the app might want to quickly click through to see later pages. So now an alert will notify the user that example input is being used.
